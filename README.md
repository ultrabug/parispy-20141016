Paris.py user group talk on 2014-10-16
======================================

My Paris.py meetup talk on fault tolerance featuring a demo of a web service able to seamlessly survive a backend failure thanks to uWSGI.

- You can find the presentation slides in the `presentation/` folder.
- uWSGI INI file is given in the `uwsgi.d/` folder. You will need to adapt it to your configuration tho.
- nginx config file is given in the `nginx.d/` folder.

Note : this is an updated version of my europython2013 talk : write a fault tolerant web service using gevent + uWSGI (see `ultrabug/ep2013` repository).
